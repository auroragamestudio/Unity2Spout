Unity2Spout is a project to experiment with communication between Unity and external applications using the Spout texture sharing technology (https://spout.zeal.co/).
The unity app renders to a rendertexture and send it with Spout using KlakSpout (https://github.com/keijiro/KlakSpout) to a python opengl viewer.
